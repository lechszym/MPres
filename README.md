Matlab Presentation Toolbox

Created by Lech Szymanski

Documentation is very limited at this time.  Run demo1.m to see how
the toolbox works, and read the script to see how to create a
presentation.

The main file of the toolbox is mpres.m, which runs a presentation
(passed in as an argumetn).  It provides functionality for navigation
the presentation.

The is a helper file mpresAnimate.m, which helps with creation of
animations.

Running a presentation that is essentially a Matlab script is a risky
thing - it can looks awesome when it works, but there's a great
potential for a crash.  The toolbox comes without any guarantees, and
to be honest, I am not entirely sure how robust it is.  In addition,
you have to have faith in your programming skills, since it will be
your code that creates presentation content - test, test, test.
